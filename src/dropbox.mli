                    [`Token of Uri.t | `Code of Uri.t option] -> Uri.t
    (** [authorize client_id response] starts the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.
        This isn't an API callâ€”it's the web page that lets the user sign
        in to Dropbox and authorize your app.  The [client_id] is the
        app's key, found in the
        {{:https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps}App Console}.  After
        the user authorizes your app, they will be sent to your redirect
        URI.  The type of response varies based on the [response]:

        - [`Token redirect_uri] (also called "implicit grant") returns
          the bearer token by redirecting the user to [redirect_uri]
          after the authorization has completed.  Extract the token
          using {!token_of_uri}.  This is useful for pure client-side
          apps, such as mobile apps or JavaScript-based apps.

        - [`Code u] if [u = Some redirect_uri], returns a code via by
          redirecting the user to [redirect_uri] (extract the code
          using {!code_of_uri}) or, if [u = None], presents the code
          to use user (on screen) who will be invited to copy it in
          your app.  The code should then be converted into a bearer
          token using {!OAuth2.token}.  This is recommended for apps
          that are running on a server.

        Note that the URI for [`Token] and [`Code] must be registered
        in the {{:https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps}App
        Console}; even 'localhost' must be listed if it is used for
        testing.

        @param state Up to 200 bytes of arbitrary data that will be
        passed back to your redirect URI. This parameter should be used
        to protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).  See
        Sections
        {{:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-4.4.1.8}4.4.1.8}
        and
        {{:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-4.4.2.5}4.4.2.5}
        of the OAuth 2.0 threat model spec.

        @param force_reapprove Whether or not to force the user to
        approve the app again if they've already done so. If [false]
        (default), a user who has already approved the application may
        be automatically redirected to the URI specified by
        [redirect_uri].  If [true], the user will not be automatically
        redirected and will have to approve the app again.

        @param disable_signup When [true] (default is [false]) users
        will not be able to sign up for a Dropbox account via the
        authorization page.  Instead, the authorization page will show a
        link to the Dropbox iOS app in the App Store.  This is only
        intended for use when necessary for compliance with App Store
        policies.  *)
