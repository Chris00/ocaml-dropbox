    (** [authorize client_id response] starts the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.
        This isn't an API callâ€”it's the web page that lets the user sign
        in to Dropbox and authorize your app.  The [client_id] is the
        app's key, found in the
        {{:https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps}App Console}.  After
        the user authorizes your app, they will be sent to your redirect
        URI.  The type of response varies based on the [response]:

        - [`Token redirect_uri] (also called "implicit grant") returns
          the bearer token by redirecting the user to [redirect_uri]
          after the authorization has completed.  Extract the token
          using {!token_of_uri}.  This is useful for pure client-side
          apps, such as mobile apps or JavaScript-based apps.

        - [`Code u] if [u = Some redirect_uri], returns a code via by
          redirecting the user to [redirect_uri] (extract the code
          using {!code_of_uri}) or, if [u = None], presents the code
          to use user (on screen) who will be invited to copy it in
          your app.  The code should then be converted into a bearer
          token using {!OAuth2.token}.  This is recommended for apps
          that are running on a server.

        Note that the URI for [`Token] and [`Code] must be registered
        in the {{:https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps}App
        Console}; even 'localhost' must be listed if it is used for
        testing.

        @param state Up to 200 bytes of arbitrary data that will be
        passed back to your redirect URI. This parameter should be used
        to protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).  See
        Sections
        {{:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-4.4.1.8}4.4.1.8}
        and
        {{:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-4.4.2.5}4.4.2.5}
        of the OAuth 2.0 threat model spec.

        @param force_reapprove Whether or not to force the user to
        approve the app again if they've already done so. If [false]
        (default), a user who has already approved the application may
        be automatically redirected to the URI specified by
        [redirect_uri].  If [true], the user will not be automatically
        redirected and will have to approve the app again.

        @param disable_signup When [true] (default is [false]) users
        will not be able to sign up for a Dropbox account via the
        authorization page.  Instead, the authorization page will show a
        link to the Dropbox iOS app in the App Store.  This is only
        intended for use when necessary for compliance with App Store
        policies.  *)

      (** A list of "delta entries".  Each delta entry is a 2-item
          list of one of the following forms:

          [(path, Some metadata)] - Indicates that there is a file/folder
          at the given path. You should add the entry to your local
          state. The metadata value is the same as what would be
          returned by the {!metadata} call, except folder metadata
          doesn't have hash or contents fields.  To correctly process
          delta entries:

          - If the new entry includes parent folders that don't yet exist in
            your local state, create those parent folders in your local state.

          - If the new entry is a file, replace whatever your local state has
            at path with the new entry.

          - If the new entry is a folder, check what your local state has at
            <path>. If it's a file, replace it with the new entry. If it's a
            folder, apply the new <metadata> to the folder, but don't modify
            the folder's children. If your local state doesn't yet include
            this path, create it as a folder.

          - If the new entry is a folder with the read-only field set to true,
            apply the read-only permission recursively to all files within the
            shared folder.

          [(path, None)] - Indicates that there is no file/folder at
          the given path. To update your local state to match,
          anything at path and all its children should be
          deleted.  Deleting a folder in your Dropbox will sometimes
          send down a single deleted entry for that folder, and
          sometimes separate entries for the folder and all child
          paths.  If your local state doesn't have anything at path,
          ignore this entry.

          Note: Dropbox treats file names in a case-insensitive but
          case-preserving way. To facilitate this, the [path] values

      Deltas are instructions on how to update your local state to
      match the server's state.

      @param cursor A value that is used to keep track of your current state.
      On the next call pass in this value to return delta entries that have
      been recorded since the cursor was returned.

      @param locale Specify language settings for user error messages
      and other language specific text.  See the
      {{:https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#param.locale}Dropbox
      documentation} for more information about supported locales.

      @param path_prefix If present, this parameter filters the
      response to only include entries at or under the specified
      path. For example, a [path_prefix] of ["/Photos/Vacation"] will
      return entries for the path "/Photos/Vacation" and any files and
      folders under that path.  If [cursor] is set, [path_prefix] is
      interpreted as the sub-path of the [path_prefix] used to create
      the cursor.  For example if your cursor has no [path_prefix],
      you can switch to any [path_prefix].  If your cursor has a
      [path_prefix] of ["/Photos"], then setting [path_prefix =
      "/Vacaction"] will switch the path for this request to
      "/Photos/Vacaction".

      @param include_media_info If true (default is [false]), each
      file will include a [photo_info] record for photos and a
      [video_info] record for videos with additional media info.  When
      [include_media_info] is specified, files will only appear in
      delta responses when the media info is ready.  This parameter is
      ignored when you use a [cursor] (the Dropbox API mandates that
      the value set at the creation of the cursor is used). *)

  val latest_cursor : ?path_prefix: string -> ?include_media_info: bool ->
                      t -> cursor Lwt.t
  (** [latest_cursor t] return a cursor (as would be returned by
      {!delta} when [has_more] is [false]).

      @param path_prefix If present, the returned cursor will be
      encoded with a [path_prefix] for the specified path for use with
      {!delta}.

      @param include_media_info If [true], the returned cursor will be
      encoded with [include_media_info] set to [true] for use with
      {!delta}. *)

  val longpoll_delta : t -> ?timeout: int -> cursor -> longpoll_delta Lwt.t
  (** [longpoll_delta t cursor] blocks the connection until changes
      are available or a timeout occurs.  In both case, a value [r]
      will be returned with [r.changes] indicating whether new changes
      are available.  If this is the case, you should call {!delta} to
      retrieve the changes. If this value is [false], it means the
      call to {!longpoll_delta} timed out.  In conjunction with
      {!delta}, this call gives you a low-latency way to monitor an
      account for file changes.

      The [cursor] is a crusor returned from a call to {!delta}.  Note
      that a cursor returned from a call to {!delta} with
      [include_media_info=true] is incompatible with {!longpoll_delta}
      and an error will be returned.

      @param timeout An integer indicating a timeout, in seconds. The
      default value is 30 seconds, which is also the minimum allowed
      value.  The maximum is 480 seconds.  The request will block for
      at most this length of time, plus up to 90 seconds of random
      jitter added to avoid the thundering herd problem.  Care should
      be taken when using this parameter, as some network
      infrastructure does not support long timeouts. *)


  val revisions : t -> ?rev_limit: int -> ?locale: string -> string ->
                  metadata list option Lwt.t
  (** [revisions t name] Return the metadata for the previous revisions of
      a file (in a list of metadata).  Only revisions up to thirty days old
      are available.  A return value of [None] means that the file does
      not exist.

      @param rev_limit Default is 10. Max is 1,000. Up to this number of
      recent revisions will be returned.

      @param locale Specify language settings for user error messages
      and other language specific text. See
      {{:https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#param.locale}Dropbox
      documentation} for more information about supported locales. *)

  val restore : t -> ?locale: string -> rev:string -> string ->
                metadata option Lwt.t
  (** [restore t rev name] Restores the file path [name] to the
      previous revision [rev].  Return the metadata of the restored
      file.  A return value of [None] means that there is no file path
      [name] with such [rev].

      If the revision is not well formed or non-existing, the function
      will fail throwing [Error Dropbox.Invalid_arg].

      @param locale Specify language settings for user error messages
      and other language specific text. See
      {{:https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#param.locale}Dropbox

               ?locale: string -> ?include_membership: bool ->
               ?fn: string -> string -> metadata list Lwt.t
  (** [search query] return the list containing the metadata for all files and
      folders whose filename contains the given search string as a substring.

      @param path The path to the folder you want to search from. Must be
      written entirely.

      @param query The search string. This string is split (on spaces) into
      individual words. Files and folders will be returned if they contain
      all words in the search string.

      @param file_limit The maximum and default value is 1,000. No more than
      [file_limit] search results will be returned.

      @param include_deleted If this parameter is set to [true], then
      files and folders that have been deleted will also be included
      in the search.  Default: [false].

      @param locale Specify language settings for user error messages
      and other language specific text. See
      {{:https://www.dropbox.com/developers/core/docs#param.locale}Dropbox

      Default: [false]. *)

  val copy_ref : t -> string -> copy_ref option Lwt.t
  (** [copy_ref t fname] creates and return a [copy_ref] to the file
      or directory [fname].  A return value of [None] means that
      [fname] does not exist.  {!copy_ref} can be used to copy that
      file to another user's Dropbox by passing it in as the
      [from_copy_ref] parameter on {!Fileops.copy}.  All links are
      currently set to expire far enough in the future so that
      expiration is effectively not an issue. *)

  (** [media t path] return a [link] directly to a file. A return value of
      [None] means that the file does not exist.

      Similar to {!shares}. The difference is that this bypasses the Dropbox
      webserver, used to provide a preview of the file, so that you can
      effectively stream the contents of your media. This URL should not be
      used to display content directly in the browser.

      Note that the {!media} link expires after four hours, allotting
      enough time to stream files, but not enough to leave a
      connection open indefinitely.

      @param locale The metadata returned on successful upload will have
      its size field translated based on the given locale.

      @param overwrite This value, either [true] (default) or [false],
      determines whether an existing file will be overwritten by this upload.
      If [true], any existing file will be overwritten. If [false], the other
      parameters determine whether a conflict occurs and how that conflict is
      resolved.

      @param parent_rev If present, this parameter specifies the revision of
      the file you're editing. If parent_rev matches the latest version of the
      file on the user's Dropbox, that file will be replaced. Otherwise, a
      [Conflict] will occur. If you specify a parent_rev and that
      revision doesn't exist, the file won't save [Invalid_arg]. You can get
      the most recent rev by performing a call to {!metadata}.

      @param autorename This value, either [true] (default) or [false],
      determines what happens when there is a conflict. If [true], the file
      being uploaded will be automatically renamed to avoid the conflict.
      (For example, test.txt might be automatically renamed to test (1).txt.)
      The new name can be obtained from the returned metadata. If [false],
      the call will fail with a Conflict response code.

      Possible errors:
      Conflict The call failed because a conflict occurred. This means a file
      already existed at the specified path, [overwrite] was [false], and the
      [parent_rev] (if specified) didn't match the current rev.

      Invalid_arg Returned if the request does not contain an [upload_id] or

  (** [commit_chunked_upload upload_id name] Return the metadata for the
      uploaded file using chunked_upload.

      @param locale The metadata returned on successful upload will have its
      size field translated based on the given locale.

      @param overwrite This value, either [true] (default) or [false],
      determines whether an existing file will be overwritten by this upload.
      If [true], any existing file will be overwritten. If [false], the other
      parameters determine whether a conflict occurs and how that conflict is
      resolved.

      @param parent_rev If present, this parameter specifies the [revision] of
      the file you're editing. If parent_rev matches the latest version of the
      file on the user's Dropbox, that file will be replaced. Otherwise, a
      conflict will occur. (See below.) If you specify a parent_rev and that
      [revision] doesn't exist, the file won't save. You can get the most
      recent rev by performing a call to [metadata].

      @param autorename This value, either [true] (default) or [false],
      determines what happens when there is a conflict. If [true], the file
      being uploaded will be automatically renamed to avoid the conflict.
      (For example, test.txt might be automatically renamed to test (1).txt.)
      The new name can be obtained from the returned metadata. If [false],
      the call will fail with a Conflict response code.

      @param upload_id Used to identify the chunked upload session you'd like
      to commit.

      Possible errors:
      Conflict The call failed because a conflict occurred. This means a file
      already existed at the specified path, [overwrite] was [false], and the
      [parent_rev] (if specified) didn't match the current rev.
