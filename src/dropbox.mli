    (** [authorize client_id] starts the OAuth 2.0 authorization flow.
        This isn't an API callâ€”it's the web page that lets the user sign
        in to Dropbox and authorize your app.  The [client_id] is the
        app's key, found in the
        {{:https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps}App Console}.  After
        the user authorizes your app, they will be sent to your redirect
        URI.  The type of response varies based on the [response_type]:

        - [`Token] (also called "implicit grant") returns a code via
          [redirect_uri] which should then be converted into a bearer
          token using {!OAuth2.token}.  This is recommended for apps
          that are running on a server.

        - [`Code] (the default) returns the bearer token via
          [redirect_uri], rather than requiring your app to make a
          second call to a server.

        @param redirect_uri Where to redirect the user after
        authorization has completed.  This must be the exact URI
        registered in the {{:https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps}App
        Console}; even 'localhost' must be listed if it is used for
        testing.  A redirect URI is required for [`Token], but optional
        for [`Code].  If the redirect URI is omitted, the code will be
        presented directly to the user and they will be invited to enter
        the information in your app.

        @param state Up to 200 bytes of arbitrary data that will be
        passed back to your redirect URI. This parameter should be used
        to protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).  See
        Sections
        {{:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-4.4.1.8}4.4.1.8}
        and
        {{:http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6819#section-4.4.2.5}4.4.2.5}
        of the OAuth 2.0 threat model spec.

        @param force_reapprove Whether or not to force the user to
        approve the app again if they've already done so. If [false]
        (default), a user who has already approved the application may
        be automatically redirected to the URI specified by
        redirect_uri.  If [true], the user will not be automatically
        redirected and will have to approve the app again.

        @param disable_signup When [true] (default is [false]) users
        will not be able to sign up for a Dropbox account via the
        authorization page.  Instead, the authorization page will show a
        link to the Dropbox iOS app in the App Store.  This is only
        intended for use when necessary for compliance with App Store
        policies.  *)
